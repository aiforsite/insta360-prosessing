# Optional GPU dependencies (PyTorch + TorchVision) for blur person detection.

# NOTE: These wheels are very large (multi-GB). On Windows, pip downloads to %TEMP% / %TMP%.
# If C: is low on space, set TMP/TEMP to a bigger drive before installing, e.g.:
#   set TMP=D:\temp
#   set TEMP=D:\temp

# IMPORTANT: torchvision versions are NOT published with "+cu121" suffix (your error showed only 0.24.1 etc).
# Select CUDA builds by using the CUDA index-url instead of "+cu121" version suffixes.
